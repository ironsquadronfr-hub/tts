/**
 * Moves everything that can safely wait into a hidden "setup crate" so the
 * table loads without paying for it, and the Global deploys it back one
 * object per frame under a loading screen (see DeferredSetup.ttslua).
 *
 * Why: TTS creates a script context for every scripted object on the table
 * during the loading bar (~40ms each, measured) and binds every visible
 * asset in the first rendered frame. Objects inside a container pay neither
 * until they are taken out — and a takeObject of a scripted object costs
 * ~40-50ms total, cheaper than the load-time path. Deferring therefore
 * shortens the loading bar and the post-load freeze, for the price of a
 * short, paced deployment cascade.
 *
 * What gets deferred is COMPUTED, never listed by hand: the mod keeps
 * growing, and a hardcoded list would rot at the first object someone adds
 * or removes. An object is deferred when nothing that stays on the table
 * can miss it while the crate is still closed — see pickDeferrable.
 *
 * The crate's GMNotes carries the deployment manifest: original position,
 * rotation and lock state per object, in dependency order.
